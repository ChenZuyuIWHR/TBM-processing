# TBM-processing
We upload 2 charts of eigenvalues and 1 zip of original DBN program again. 
The eigenvalues charts contain TPI-raw, R2,  chainage and TPI-pre on collapse area 9#. One is handled without data processed program,the other is handled with data processed program. 
The zip contains source programs such as DBN, NN and CNN. Among them, DBN and NN are the main programs used in Section 5.3. Readers can implement this case on the basis of appropriate modifications.
